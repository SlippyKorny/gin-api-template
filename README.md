# Gin API Template

This template contains a project structure that I personally use when developing REST APIs with the gin web framework.
It follows [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) and the [clean code architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

(This template is still being developed and this README is not complete yet)
